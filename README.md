# Snake Game
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food , trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer and its score increases, making the game increasingly difficult.
